This is my repository for my self-projects, where I explore data science, machine learning, and data analysis. I enjoy working on different problems, experimenting with new techniques, and building practical solutions. Some of these projects Iâ€™ve worked on alone, while others are collaborations with my partner ðŸ’¡âœ¨.
