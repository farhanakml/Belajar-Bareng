# Amazon Sales Report 
This project involves comprehensive data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization of Amazon's sales performance in India for Q2 2022. The goal of the project is to analyze key metrics, trends, and insights regarding sales distribution, revenue generation, and product performance. The analysis results are showcased through an interactive Tableau dashboard for intuitive exploration.

## Introduction
This project presents a thorough analysis of Amazon's sales in India for Q2 2022. The analysis is conducted after preprocessing raw sales data, which includes handling missing values, formatting dates, and preparing the data for visualization. The analysis covers state-wise distribution of sales, revenue generated from different shipping methods, sales trends across various product categories, and more. The dashboard makes it easier to explore key insights, such as which states generate the highest revenue, what product sizes are most popular, and how the sales status (shipped or canceled) is distributed.
